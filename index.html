        How do we become the people we need to be to live the lives we want to live, do the things we want to do, and
        face the challenges we want to (or must, because of forces beyond our control) capably face?
    </p>
    <p>
        There are countless ways to pursue this type of outcome, but the one I’ve found to be most effective and
        sustainable (for me) is to implement small, simple, daily changes and maintain them over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, this means deciding to put away yesterday’s washed dishes each morning before you do anything else
        because that makes you feel productive and accomplished first thing, leading into the rest of your day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or maybe it means deciding to take up a new learning path, formal or informal, and making
        reading/study/research/practice part of each afternoon, evening, or whenever else you consistently have (or can
        set aside) time for such things.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key is to keep your plans simple so they don’t abstract away into pointless milestones or spiral into
        bigger—unsustainable—undertakings.

    <p>Here is a quote from <abbr title="World Wild Life">WWF's</abbr> website:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
        For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
        The world's leading conservation organization,
        WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
        1.2 million members in the United States and
        close to 5 million globally.
